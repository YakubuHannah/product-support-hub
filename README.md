# Product-Support Alignment Hub – Vibe Coding Challenge

## Project Overview
This project solves the long-standing gap between the Product and Support teams at Fincra by introducing a lightweight, automated hub for logging feature requests, tracking product progress, and surfacing insights for decision-making.

It combines Airtable, Slack automation, and a custom React front-end to create a collaborative system for feedback-driven product improvement.
